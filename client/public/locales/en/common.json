      "0": {
        "question": "How long does a hair transplant operation take?",
        "answer": "A hair transplant operation takes approximately 6-8 hours. This duration may vary depending on the number of grafts to be transplanted and the technique used. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "What is the recovery process like after hair transplantation?",
        "answer": "While the recovery process varies from person to person, generally the first 2 weeks are critically important. You can return to work from the 3rd day. Complete healing and seeing results takes 6-12 months."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "Is hair transplantation a permanent solution?",
        "answer": "Yes, hair transplantation is a permanent solution. Since the transplanted hair is taken from an area genetically resistant to hair loss, it remains without falling out for life. However, it is important to maintain proper care to protect existing hair."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "Is there an age limit for hair transplantation?",
        "answer": "The ideal age range for hair transplantation is 25-55. However, each case is evaluated individually. What's important is that hair loss has stabilized and there is sufficient donor area available."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "When can one return to daily life after the operation?",
        "answer": "You can return to daily life 3 days after the operation. However, it is recommended to wait 1 month for activities such as sports and swimming. During the first 2 weeks, care should be taken against sun exposure, sweating, and impacts."
